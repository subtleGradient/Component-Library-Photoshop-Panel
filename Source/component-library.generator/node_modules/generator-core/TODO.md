Generator TODOs
===============

Note: If you put a TODO in this document, also add the date and your initials.

1. 5/23/13 - JRB - Add connection timeout code
2. 5/23/13 - JRB - Look into updating to node v0.10.x
3. 5/23/13 - JRB - Write a README
4. 5/23/13 - JRB - Possibly make plugin loading asynchronous
5. 5/23/13 - JRB - Consider changing plugin loading so that folders don't have to end in ".generate". One alternative is to specify something in package.json that says this folder is a Generator plugin. Would also give us a chance to check version info.
6. 5/28/13 - JRB - Make PhotoshopConnection entirely event-based and remove dependence on Q in that file. Biggest change will be moving auth code to generator.js.
7. 5/28/13 - JRB - Rename jsx files to be lowercase_with_underscores as is node convention.
